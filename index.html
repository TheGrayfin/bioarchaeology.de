    <p style="margin-top:6px; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.5;">
      The Tyrolean Iceman, a 5,300-year-old Copper Age individual, was discovered in 1991
      on the Tisenjoch Pass in the Italian part of the Ötztal Alps. Here we report the
      complete genome sequence of the Iceman and show 100% concordance between the
      previously reported mitochondrial genome sequence and the consensus sequence
      generated from our genomic data. We present indications for recent common ancestry
      between the Iceman and present-day inhabitants of the Tyrrhenian Sea, that the
      Iceman probably had brown eyes, belonged to blood group O and was lactose intolerant.
      His genetic predisposition shows an increased risk for coronary heart disease and
      may have contributed to the development of previously reported vascular
      calcifications. Sequences corresponding to ∼60% of the genome of
      <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> are indicative of the earliest human case of infection
      with the pathogen for Lyme borreliosis.

    <p style="margin-top:6px; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.5;">
      The radiological examinations carried out on the Tyrolean Iceman (5300 B.P.) in Bolzano between 2001 and 2006 have undergone a new, systematic re-appraisal, during which new findings have been added to those already known beforehand. Until now, it has been assumed that the Iceman’s stomach was empty (due to the fact that this organ could not be localised), the colon contents constituting the Iceman’s last meal. During this re-appraisal, however, the stomach could not only be exactly identified, but was also found to be well-filled, shedding new light on the scenario leading to his violent death. In addition, several other novel aspects were observed: three gallbladder stones were found which, in combination with the previously identified atherosclerosis, indicate that the Iceman’s diet may have been richer in animal products than previous studies have suggested. The signs of enthesopathy in the knees indicate that he spent many hours wandering in the mountains. Several radio-opaque objects superficially embedded within the soft tissue were identified as being of taphonomic origin. The right humerus was found to be postmortally fractured.

    <p style="margin-top:6px; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.5;">
      Vanzetti et al. (2010) recently advanced the hypothesis that the complex assemblage
      of the Tyrolean Iceman represented an intentional, ceremonial burial, as opposed to
      his having suffered accidental or violent death in the high alpine area, and his
      body having then naturally mummified in the conditions of the local environment.
      This hypothesis was mainly based, on the one hand, on the spatial distribution of
      the find complex, and on the other, on previously published pollen analyses, which
      (in the opinion of Vanzetti et al.) point towards a time-span of several months
      between death and subsequent placement of the body at the Tisenjoch pass. Although
      the initial theory that the find complex was re-distributed after death concurs
      with existing theories, the conclusions drawn from this observation by Vanzetti
      et al. disregard several important factors. In our opinion, neither the distribution
      of objects nor the palaeobotanical data support a ‘burial hypothesis’, and the
      forensic-pathological data actually contradicts the scenario put forward by
      Vanzetti et al. They also describe several archaeohistorical parallels (grave goods,
      burial traditions) as supporting the burial hypothesis; however, these arguments are
      unconvincing when analysed more closely.

    <p style="margin-top:6px; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.5;">
      Next-generation high-throughput techniques, which allow an enormous amount of
      genetic material to be sequenced within a relatively short time, are becoming
      increasingly popular within the field of palaeogenetics. In recent years, these
      techniques have enabled large-scale projects such as the sequencing of entire
      mitochondrial genomes of the Neanderthal and the woolly mammoth, which would
      hardly have been possible with standard PCR. However, the high running costs of
      next-generation technology necessitate a careful sample selection. Whilst DNA
      damages are continually repaired in the living, healthy organism, various factors
      such as endogenous processes, environmental influence and soil composition cause
      increasing degradation of the DNA after death. Due to the high copy number per
      cell, mitochondrial DNA can often be extracted and sequenced. On the other hand,
      nuclear DNA with only two copies per cell, or Y-chromosomal DNA with only a single
      copy per cell in the male individual, tends to be much more difficult to amplify
      successfully. To estimate the quantitative and qualitative aDNA preservation
      status for specific samples, a multiplex PCR was developed, allowing multiple
      segments of varying sizes from nuclear and mitochondrial genome to be amplified
      in one run and thus providing information on the degree of strand damage. This way,
      the expected success rate of next-generation sequencing of a given sample can be
      determined beforehand, increasing the cost-effectiveness of such methods by only
      using promising sample material. The multiplex PCR was developed and tested on
      Iron Age skeletons from East Kazakhstan and the Altai within the scope of the
      project “Palaeogenetic analyses of economic advances and social mobility within
      the Eurasian Steppe 3500–300 B.C.”.

      Abstract
    </summary>

    <p style="margin-top:8px;">
      The diagnosis and analysis of neoplasms in historic and prehistoric human bone remains remains a challenging task
      in palaeopathology. Definite morphological signs, whether as primary tumours or metastases, are rare compared with
      many other pathological conditions, and reports of ancient cancer cases remain infrequent. This, however, should
      not be interpreted as evidence for a low prevalence of neoplasms in past populations, as the absence of effective
      treatments would often have resulted in death before skeletal metastasis occurred. Furthermore, metastatic lesions
      may easily be confused with taphonomic damage if not carefully analysed. Most diagnostic methods used in modern clinical practice are of limited applicability in palaeopathology, which
      relies primarily on morphological, radiological, endoscopic, and more rarely biochemical analyses. As an example,
      we present a skull from an Early Medieval site in South Tyrol. Osteolytic lesions of the cranial vault, initially
      resembling mechanical damage, were diagnosed as carcinoma metastases following detailed macromorphological and
      radiological examination. A further focus is the potential application of ancient DNA analysis to confirm suspected tumour cases. To date,
      no such experiments have been reported. The increasing use of next-generation sequencing in palaeopathology,
      combined with developments in modern oncology and the Cancer Genome Project, may provide new insights into the
      palaeoepidemiology of neoplastic disease and contribute to a better understanding of cancer pathogenesis in modern
      populations.

      The Tyrolean Iceman represents one of the most valuable biological archives available for the study of ancient human genetics. This presentation describes the application of next-generation sequencing technologies to overcome the limitations of conventional PCR-based approaches when analyzing highly fragmented ancient DNA. Using SOLiD4 sequencing, a high-coverage draft of the Iceman’s nuclear genome was generated from minimal bone material, achieving broad genome coverage and reliable authentication through characteristic ancient DNA damage patterns and independent verification. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses enabled the identification of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms, determination of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroups, and the exploration of phenotypically and clinically relevant genetic variants. In addition, metagenomic analysis provided insight into non-human DNA present in the sample. These results demonstrate the transformative potential of next-generation sequencing in mummy studies and establish the Iceman’s genome as a long-term resource for interdisciplinary palaeogenomic research.

      To investigate alternative conservation strategies and improve understanding of
      taphonomic processes, an experimental human ice mummification project was
      initiated. A donated human body (“Ö3”) was preserved using chemical fixation and
      stored under controlled subzero temperature and high-humidity conditions designed
      to minimize dehydration. Despite stable environmental parameters, significant
      tissue shrinkage and limitations related to formaldehyde fixation were observed,
      restricting the range of histological, genetic, and radiological investigations.
      The experiment highlights both the potential and the constraints of using
      artificially preserved human mummies for conservation research and underscores
      the ethical, legal, and methodological challenges inherent in experimental human
      mummification studies.

    <p style="margin-top:6px; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.5;">
      Cholelithiasis has been documented in ancient populations primarily through the
      study of mummified remains, yet detailed characterization has often been limited by
      preservation and technology. This study presents a radiological re-evaluation of
      the Tyrolean Iceman (Ötzi) using modern multislice computed tomography, integrating
      data from earlier CT examinations with advanced post-processing techniques. Three
      small, round calcified objects consistent with gallstones were identified within
      the gallbladder region. Density measurements and morphologic criteria suggest a
      predominantly mixed gallstone composition. Although gallstones are frequently
      asymptomatic, their presence provides valuable insight into the Iceman’s metabolic
      status, dietary habits, and possible genetic predispositions. These findings
      contribute to the growing field of palaeopathology and highlight the role of modern
      imaging in refining diagnoses in ancient human remains.

      Abstract

    <p style="margin-top:6px; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.5;">
      Palaeo-oncology offers a unique perspective on the antiquity, prevalence, and
      biological behavior of malignant disease in past populations. This presentation
      examines a rare case of metastatic carcinoma identified in human skeletal remains
      from Northern Italy, using macroscopic and radiological criteria to differentiate
      metastatic disease from multiple myeloma and other differential diagnoses. The
      distribution, morphology, and remodeling patterns of the lesions support a
      diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma, although identification of the primary tumor
      remains challenging. Beyond this case study, the presentation discusses the
      broader implications for palaeo-oncology, including the role of life expectancy
      in cancer development and the potential contribution of ancient DNA analyses to
      the study of hereditary cancer predisposition and tumor-related genetic
      alterations. While methodological limitations remain substantial, integrating
      imaging, morphology, and molecular approaches may transform palaeo-oncology from
      a discipline reliant on chance discoveries into a systematic tool for
      reconstructing cancer epidemiology and tumor evolution in ancient populations.
